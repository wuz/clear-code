## Introduction

The internet contains countless debates and arguments about what good code _is_. Tabs vs. Space. Lots of comments vs. self documenting functions. `if/else` vs `switch/case`. The list goes on and on, but the usefulness of these debates is hardly ever clear. Instead, we occilate based on what the newest langauge prefers or what the now-in-vogue framework does. And yet we continue to have bad code. How can this be?

### Why another "clean code" book?

Here's a quick experiment, one purely based in conjecture and surely not representative of real life. Let's imagine a seminal work (we'll call it CODE CLEAN) on "clean code", written in 2008. George Bush Jr. is still in office and Obama is a couple months from being elected. Blogger is the most popular website in the United States and the iPhone has just hit it's third generation.

Coding bootcamps are quite young and Stack Overflow is still a couple months from being launched. Java is a big deal and EcmaScript 5 (the first major revision to Javascript), is still a year away. Now, let's fast forward this reality to the current year (2021 at the time of writing). Referencing our hypothetical book, CODE CLEAN, might be questionable given the pace and change of code over the last 13 years.

Now, just for fun, let's imagine that within the tech field there are still massive problems for people of color, women, and LGBTQ+ folks (a wild hypothetical, I know!). The author of that CODE CLEAN book has, hypothetically, been known as particularly vitriolic and harmful towards those groups for quite some time. Despite the age of the book and the quality of its author, let's assume the book has continued to be recommended as an introductory text in the field of Software Engineering.

In this pure hypothetical, it would seem that there is a need for a new book on the topic, would it not?

### What does Clear Code even mean?

Clear code, in contrast to "clean" code is code that is written to express clarity above all else. Code clarity is the result of intentional decisions about architecture, formatting, and communication made by a team about their codebase. This book is designed to act as a guide to the conversations you can have with your team about making your code clear and to provide examples of what clear code can look like for many organization.

#### Clear Code vs Clean Code

I find examples to be the best tool for explaining concepts, especially related to code. Here I want to present a quick example of _clear code_, and show how it differs from _clean code_.
The original "clean code" book says that `if/else` statements are a code smell, since it means your functions are doing more than one thing. In many codebases this kind of heuristic does provide clearer code, however one doesn't have to look far to find a great example of this breaking down. In the Kubernetes source code, we can find incredibly _clear code_, that doesn't meet the definition of _clean code_.

**Great, clear documentation**

Good documentation is a core tenet of Clear Code. Large blocks of documentation like this are often abstracted out into knowledge base systems, which reduces their clearness. More on this in LINK</figcaption>

**Clear, but not "clean"**

Combined with good documentation and reasoning, lots of `if` statements quickly move into clear code territory, even when they wouldn't typically be considered "clean"

### A Systems approach

<!-- TODO: This section is long and not super relavant. I likely will distill the information here into a quick description of systems. -->

"Thinking in Systems" by Donella Meadows is the seminal work on systems thinking - the process of analyzing the systems that exist around us and learning to make tweaks that change the system. Systems exist all across our lives - our companies, the traffic we sit in, and the trees by the side of the road are all systems. In her book, Donella presents the idea that systems can be broken into three major categories: _elements_, _interconnections_, and _function/purpose_.

Elements are the individual pieces that make up a system - your coworkers, the cars around you, and the cells of the tree are all elements of the system. Interconnections are the what holds elements together - corporate hierarchy, traffic laws, and the metabolic processes of the tree. Finally, function/purpose is the reason that a system exists - to produce profit, to insure the safety of people on the road, and the propagation of more trees. While elements are usually fairly easy to see, interconnections and functions (which we will use instead of purpose moving forward) are often obscured and require time spent looking at the system.

This book is concerned with the systems that impact the quality and readability of our code. At the end of each major idea in this book, you will find clear cut examples of a system - with it's elements, interconnections, and function - along with system tweaks I have seen work well across organizations.

The other key aspects of systems thinking are stocks, flows, and feedback loops. Stocks are observable/quantifiable parts of a system. Flows determine stock levels. A good example of this is in a code system: stock could be the number of bugs you have. An inflow is the creation of new bugs. An outflow occurs when fixing bugs. Stocks and flows aren't always clear, but with a bit of attention to the system, we can usually find some kind of stock and flow. A feedback loop is a process by which flows are triggered by a change in stock. Feedback loops can increase, decrease, or maintain stock levels. In our bug example, adding new code to poorly designed architecture could lead to far more bugs, increasing the stock significantly. A rewrite of some architecture could decrease the amount of bugs, decreasing the stock.

## What lies within

A wise Rubyist once waxed that a book is supposed to start with _synergy_ - at this point in the book, you and I should be getting along well. You should trust me to lead you through this book. However, while this introduction has introduced the concept of clear code, it has yet to introduce me. Without further ado:

Howdy, I'm **wuz** and I'm here to hopefully give you some strategies to bring clarity to your code. I've been building software for over 10 years now and in those years, I've written a lot of code. Not all of that code was clear (or even that good), but in that time I have read much more code than I've written.

Here is the first foundational truth of clear code: **all developers read more code than they will ever write**. Luckily, the more code I have read, the more I've been to recognize good, clear code and replicate it.

I've worked in PHP, Angular, React, Ruby, Python, and on and on. So many languages, so many paradigms... And yet, a number of similarities. I've spent the last few years working closely with other developers - teaching and learning in kind. This is the second foundational truth of clear code - **all developers will talk and write about code far more than they will write code.**

I've spent time writing, reading, and communicating about code at startups and at larger companies. I've done contract work, enterprise software, and marketing websites. Many of these codebases lacked clarity, often times because of me. I've spent a lot of time regretting that lack, but in it I have found the third foundational truth of clear code: **all developers will have to weigh the opportunity cost of writing clear code.** Sometimes, creating clear code will not be worth it. That's ok.

Ok, hopefully we are on the same page now. Let's head to the next one together.

This book isn't super long. There are five chapters, including this introduction. The advice here aims to be practical and straightforward. The ideas in here aren't new and I didn't come up with them. I've even pulled the most important information into "big idea" blocks, which look like this:

<div class="big-idea">
<span class="big-idea-icon">âœ¨</span>
Pick a formatter or linter. Run it on all your files
</div>

Each big idea is actionable and straightforward.
