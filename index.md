# Welcome to Clear Code

When talking about code, we often spend our time debating standards and "clean code" practices.
Focusing on clean code often leads to dogmatic beliefs about what makes good code, when instead
the real focus should be on writing _clear_ code. Clear code focuses on readability, team dynamics,
and future-proofing our systems of development.
